# ScribeBot

ScribeBot is a highly scriptable automation system.

With a little knowledge of Lua, you can automate mundane tasks, create macros or even create a bot.

## Program Features
- Lua interpreter plugged to numerous APIs and libraries - create robust systems without expert knowledge.
- Simple and easy interface - it's not beautiful, but it works.
- Packaging system - keep scripts and info about them bundled together.
- Workshop - find and download community-made scripts with just one click.
- Built-in package editor - edit packages without having to unzip them.
- Logging system - find out what broke when you were away.

## Libraries
| Library  | Functionality (Short) | Third-party dependency |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| audio | Play sounds, get device current peak level | NAudio |
| core | Manage windows, write to console, process console input | - |
| database | Read and save data to a local database | SQLite |
| input | Emulate keyboard/mouse input | - |
| interface | Create 'value input request' prompts | - |
| screen | Recognize text, capture screen, read screen pixels, manage screens | Tesseract |
| webdriver | Create web automations | Selenium |
| core | Manage windows, write to console, process console input | - |

## Known bugs and odd-behavior
- None

## Code Examples

Below you can find a simplistic stopwatch script.

It'll keep counting seconds that have passed since it's been started and it'll continue doing so until you set 'count' to false.

core.processConsoleInput() is crucial here, otherwise sending 'count = false' via console won't be executed.

```lua
count = true
i = 0

while(count) do
	i = i + 1

	print(i)

	wait(1000)

	core.processConsoleInput()
end
```

## Important Notice
This program uses unmanaged code (see: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms973872.aspx#manunman_topic6) and provides low-level functionality that if used improperly (intentionally or not) could affect system's security and reliability.
It's possible to write a malicious script - it's **highly advised** to open packages with package editor and read code before executing it, especially if it comes from untrusted sources.
