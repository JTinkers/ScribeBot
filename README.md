ScribeBot is a highly scriptable automation system.

With a little knowledge of Lua, you can automate mundane tasks, create macros or even create a bot.

## Important Notice
This program uses unmanaged code ([msdn topic](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms973872.aspx#manunman_topic6)) and provides low-level functionality that if used improperly (intentionally or not) could affect system's security and reliability.
It's possible to write a malicious script - it's **highly advised** to open packages with package editor and read code before executing it, especially if it comes from untrusted sources.

## Program Features
- Lua interpreter plugged to numerous APIs and libraries - create robust systems without expert knowledge.
- Simple and easy interface - it's not beautiful, but it works.
- Packaging system - keep scripts and info about them bundled together.
- Workshop - find and download community-made scripts with just one click.
- Built-in package editor - edit packages without having to unzip them.
- Logging system - find out what broke when you were away.

## Known bugs and odd-behavior
- None

## Code Examples

You can find a simplistic stopwatch script below.

It'll keep counting seconds that have passed since it's been started and it'll continue doing so until you set `count` to `false`.

`core.processConsoleInput()` is crucial here, otherwise sending `count = false` via console won't be executed.

```lua
count = true
i = 0

while(count) do
	i = i + 1

	print(i)

	wait(1000)

	core.processConsoleInput()
end
```
